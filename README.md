# Nutrition Tracker

## Capstone Project 1 


[Title](https://www..com)

Nutrition Tracker is a website designed to help you track what you are eating. A user can create their own account and enter goals for the daily number of calories, carbohydtrates, protein, and fat they want to consume. A user logs the foods they eat each day. The website will sum the nutrition info and show a comparison to the user's goals.

Nutrition Tracker uses the Nutritionix API. It is a natural language API, so searching for foods and quantities is very flexible. For example, enter a search query for "1 cup rice" or "150 grams Chicken", and the API will return the nutrition info for that query. 

After searching for a food, select the date and meal you want that food added to. When adding a food, you can choose to save it to your favorites. Your favorite foods are stored so that you can quickly add them to your daily log. This is helpful for foods that you eat regularly.

On the home page there is a summary of the user's daily calorie goals, how many calories have been consumed so far that day, and how many calories are remaining to reach the goal. The same info is provided in the summary for grams of carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
